- Consider N * N grid of sites(blocks)
- Each site/block had p probability of being open or 1-p of being blocked
- System is said to be percolated if top and bottom are connected by open sites/blocks

eg:- Electricity flows, water flows, social network connected etc..


Monte Carlo simulation can help define the threshold at which system starts to perculate i.e. threshold is the probability
of open spaces becoming high.

How to check if N^2 site percolates?
=====================================
We can use dynamic connectivity model here...

- Create object for each site/block and name them from 0..N^2
- Sites are in same component if connected by open sites.
- Change one site at a time and see if we percolate...
