Stacks
======
ADT
LIFO

Push/Pop

Implement using linked-list
============================
Add to the start and remove from the start
https://github.com/sandeepbaldawa/Programming-Concepts-Python/blob/master/algorithms_robert_sedge/week_2_stack_ll.py


- Every operation takes constant time in worst case.
- Extra time and space for managing links.

Implement using arrays
=======================
- Every operation takes constant amortized time.
- Less space wasted.


Queue
======
ADT
FIFO

Template
========
class QueueOfStrings():
    def __init(self, capacity):
       self.capacity = capacity 
    def enqueue(item):
    def dequeue()
    def isEmpty()
    def size()

Implement using linked-list
