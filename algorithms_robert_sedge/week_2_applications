Stack
- Functions calls
   On function call
   1. Push local environment and return address.
   2. Pop return call and local environment.
   
One can always use stack instead of a recursive call

eg:-
def gcd(p, q):
   if q == 0:
     return q
   gcd(p, p % q)
   
 
- Evaluate infix opertaions
(1 + ((2 + 3)) *  (4 * 5 )))

   Two stack algorithm
   operand and operator stacks
   - Value push on the value stack
   - Operator push on operator stack
   - Left paranthesis ignore
   - Right paranthesis
     pop operator and two values 
     push the result of applying that operator to those values on the operand stack
