Why Scale?
=========
Store more requests
store more data
resiliency
server requests faster

What to Scale?
==============
Bandwidth
Storage
Computers(memory, CPU)
Power

Techniques?
==========
1. Optimizing Code .. cost to add machine/maintainence vs cost for a developer to change code
2. Caching complex operations
3. upgrade machines...more memory, cpu, storage..
4. Add more machines..

Caching?
========
Storing result of an operation so that subsequent/future requests become faster.

When to Cache?
=============
Computation is slow
Caching will run multiple times
When output is same for a particular input
Your hosting provider charges for db accesses

# Cache is usually a large hashtable
if request in cache:  # Hit
  return cache[request]
else: # Miss
  r = db_read(). # 100 ms
  cache[request] = r
  return r
