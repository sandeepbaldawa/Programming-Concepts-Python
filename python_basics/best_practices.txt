- Use enumerate
- Use zip when trying to iterate two lists same time
  for x,y in zip(list1,list2):
      print "{0}{1}".format(x,y)
- swap x, y = y, x      
- querying for keys which might or might not be in the dictionary
  val = dict.get('Query',None) # If Query key is not present val we get is None, this prevents exception being thrown
- for files always use with
   with open('myfile.txt','w+') as f:
      for line in f:
         print line
- Use finally with try catch, very handy even if exceptions are thrown..
