Server Performance Monitoring
==============================

Performance Testing is not just testing. it is the process of identifying the performance issues.
Well, when you identify that performance is poor, what will be the next step? Obviously it is to find out the root cause 
of the performance problem. Here is where Performance Monitoring helps. In other words, it helps to gather more data from 
the server side to narrow down the root cause of the performance problem.

What to monitor?
=====================
Before determining what needs to be monitored, it is important to understand different type of 
resources involved in a software deployment and level of monitoring required for each type of resources .
Let us consider the case of Web application which has a typical 3 tier architecture â€“ Web, App & DB. Let us also assume Web,
App and DB servers are deployed in one physical server.

What is 3 tier architecture?
============================
Presentation layer => Receives input and displays output . (Web Browsers)
Application tier => Logic and Calculation                  (Shopping Cart Code) 
Database tier => store and manage data                     (Shipping and Order processing Database)
