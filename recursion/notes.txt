- Recursion has a terminating case
- Varying input for each call(else it would be an inifnite loop and not terminate)
- Recursive decomposition
   a. Solve problem using result from smaller problems.
   b. identify base case
- Common patterns
   a. Handle first and/or last recur on the remaining.
   b. Divide in two halves and recur on one/both.(Binary Search)
   c. Make a choice among options and recur on the updated state. (Permutation/Combination)
   
- Procedural vs functional recursion
  Procedural no value returned (draw some pixels recursively)
  Function value is returned

Permutations and Subsets are about choice
Width of branching represents number of options available for each decision

Exhaustive recursion
-----------------------
Explore all possible outcomes at every decision point
Pemutation => N!
Subsets => 2^N

Partial exploration of exhaustive space
----------------------------------------
Stop at some satisfactory outcome


Backtracking
--------------------
bool Solve(configuration conf) {
     if (no more choices) // BASE CASE
         return (conf is goal state);
     
     for (all available choices) {
         try one choice c;
         
        // recursively solve after making choice
        ok = Solve(conf with choice c made);
       
        if (ok)
            return true;
        else
            unmake choice c;
     }
   return 
}

Pegion Hole principal
----------------------
In mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.[1] This theorem is exemplified in real-life by truisms like "there must be at least two left gloves or two right gloves in a group of three gloves"
