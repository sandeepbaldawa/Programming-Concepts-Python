# query in two different but related tables
# tables are citizenloc and citizens

use demo;
select name,age from citizens where name='flex';
select name from citizenloc where location='texas';

What if we need to run both queries together?
select name,age from citizens where name=(select name from citizenloc where location='texas');


#sql joins
# first see the common column in two tables
select c.name, cl.location, c.age from citizens as c join from citizenloc as cl on c.name=cl.name;

select c.name, cl.location, c.age from citizens as c join from citizenloc as cl on c.name=cl.name where cl.location='california';
