What is SSH?
============
. SSH is a client/server based protocol 
2. An SSH server program, typically installed and run by a system administrator, accepts or rejects incoming
connections to its host computer.
3. Users then run SSH client programs, typically on
other computers, to make requests of the SSH server, such as “Please log me in,”
“Please send me a file,” or “Please execute this command.”
4. All communications between clients and servers are securely encrypted and protected from modification.
5. In summary  SSH creates a channel for running a shell on a remote computer, with end-to-end encryption between the two
systems.

How terminal devices are initialized?
=====================================
1. The system administrator creates a file, usually /etc/ttys, that has one line per terminal device. 
Each line specifies the name of the device and other parameters that are passed to the getty program.

2. When the system is bootstrapped, the kernel creates process ID 1, the init process, and it is init 
that brings the system up in multiuser mode. The init process reads the file /etc/ttys and, for every terminal 
device that allows a login, does a fork followed by an exec of the program getty.

3. It is getty that calls open for the terminal device. The terminal is opened for reading and writing.
   Once the device is open, file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 are set to the device. Then getty outputs something like login: 
   and waits for us to enter our user name. When we enter our user name, getty’s job is complete, and it then invokes 
   the login program
   
   init (ID 1) ====> init and exec ===> getty (opens file descriptors 0,1,2, reads username, initial environemnt) ==> login
              forks
 
              

What happens on the SSH client side?
===================================
1. A user on another host (that is connected to the server’s host through a network of some form)
or on the same host initiates the login by starting the ssh client:

ssh hostname



DNS lookup

What happens on the server side?
