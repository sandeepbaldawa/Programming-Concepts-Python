File

A file just means a bunch of bytes arranged in a certain order. 
It's what normal people call the contents of a file. When Linux opens a file, 
it also creates a file object, which holds data about where the file is stored and what processes are using it. 
The file object (but not the file data itself) is thrown away when the file is closed.

Inode

An inode (short for "index node") is a bunch of attributes about a file that Linux stores. 
There is one inode for each file (though with some filesystems, Linux has to create its own inodes because
the information is spread around the filesystem). The inode stores information like who owns the file, 
how big the file is, and who is allowed to open the file. Each inode also contains a number unique to the 
filesystem partition; it's like a serial number for the file described by that inode.

Dentry

A dentry (short for "directory entry") is what the Linux kernel uses to keep track of the hierarchy of files in 
directories. Each dentry maps an inode number to a file name and a parent directory.

Superblock

The superblock is a unique data structure in a filesystem (though multiple copies exist to guard against corruption). 
The superblock holds metadata about the filesystem, like which inode is the top-level directory and the type of filesystem
used.

How to find superblock?
======================
dumpe2fs /dev/foo | grep -i superblock

How to find inode no for a file?
================================
ls -li filename
stat fileName-Here

df -i
df -i

Delete all inodes related to a file?
===================================
$ find . -inum 1448239 -exec rm -i {} \;
rm: remove regular empty file `./"ab*'? y


Find all files with a given inode no
=====================================
debugfs -R "ncheck your_inode_num" /dev/sda
