What is an inode?
=================

An inode is a data structure in Unix that contains metadata about a file. Some of the items contained in an inode are:
1) mode
2) owner (UID, GID)
3) size
4) atime, ctime, mtime
5) acl’s
6) blocks list of where the data is

The filename is present in the parent directory’s inode structure.

What is the difference between a soft link and a hard link?
===========================================================

1) Hardlink shares the same inode number as the source link. Softlink has a different inode number. Example:

$ touch a
$ ln a b
$ ls -i a b
24 a  24 b
$ ln -s a c
$ ls -i a c
24 a  25 c

2) In the data portion of the softlink is the name of the source file
3) Hardlinks are only valid in the same filesystem, softlinks can be across filesystems

When would you use a hardlink over a softlink?
==============================================
A hardlink is useful when the source file is getting moved around, because renaming the source does not remove 
the hardlink connection. On the other hand, if you rename the source of a softlink, the softlink is broken. 
This is because hardlink’s share the same inode, and softlink uses the source filename in it’s data portion.

ls -i a
  232177 a
ls -i b
  232177 b
So ln a b is roughly equivalent to cp a b, but there are several important differences:

The contents of the file are only stored once, so you don't use twice the space.
If you change a, you're changing b, and vice-versa.
If you change the permissions or ownership of a, you're changing those of b as well, and vice-versa.
