questions
=========
machines:- sizing, heterogenous, IOPs, queueing, upload/download capacity..
Network:- bandwidth, network localization, i.e how many hops are different machines.
latency, link quality, reliability on the network size
- content of files changing? IO patterns


advantages of distributed hashing with consistent hashing
=========================================================
1. Node add or remove only K/N keys need to be moved.
2. we can rebalance as and when needed based on the hots spots.
3. performance consistency
