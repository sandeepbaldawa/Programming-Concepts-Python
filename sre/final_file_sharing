questions
=========
machines:- sizing, heterogenous, IOPs, queueing, upload/download capacity..
Network:- bandwidth, network localization, i.e how many hops are different machines.
latency, link quality, reliability on the network size
- content of files changing? IO patterns

Design
======
1. We have 10K buckets(destination server nodes) in which we need to send the 1TB size file. Hence we could
   take the 1TB file and divide it into 100K chunks such that each bucket would receive 10 chunks.
2. We could do the above using consistent hashing. Advantages of distributed hashing with consistent hashing
    a. Node add or remove only K/N keys need to be moved.
    b. we can rebalance as and when needed based on the hots spots.
    c. performance consistency
3. We could first hash 
   a. each machine by maybe it's ip address 
   b. each chunk by the inode + offset
4. We could create replicated copied of chunks for reliability.
