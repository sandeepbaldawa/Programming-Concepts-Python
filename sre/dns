- maps domain names to ip address
- is a service on the TCP/IP n/w
- DHCP dynamically assigns ip address to machines on the n/w
- usually built into routers for normal users
- In enterprise world we have windows servers and bind which can serve as dns
- dhcp servers should always talk to dns servers, because when a dhcp server generates a dynamic ip, 
  that should be recorded in the dns tables
- reverse dns maps ipaddr to domain name

Basic working
=============
1. User requests for www.google.com
2. Request goes to DNS which returns the ip addr the domain name matches to
3. User computer uses this ipaddr to go through the router to the internet to find which subnet/machine/port the ipaddr
   maps to and connects to the same.


- Important to note that a given DNS server will have mappings only for the local LAN
- So if the DNS server does not have a record in it's table's it will query the remote DNS server to get the mapping

Components of DNS
=================
Distributed database system that can serve as foundation for name resolution in TCP/IP.
1. Domain Name Space
   Provides structure of DNS distributed database.
   Is like a n-ary tree with the root domain as "."
   First level domain name can be organization names(like org, edu, com etc..)
   Second level domain names are registered to individuals (like microsoft.com, stanford.edu etc..)
   fqdn maps host name to ip address
2. Zones
   for administrative purposes domains can be organized into zones
   discrete and contiguous area of domain names space
   helps in delegating forwading, one large domain name can be difficult to administor
3. Name Servers
Name Resolution Process

What are zones?
==============
- Zones are how the database records for dns are stored.
- 4 main zone types
   Primary Zone
   Primary Zone with Active Directory integration
   Secondary Zone
   Stub Zone
   
PRIMARY ZONE
============
Primary Zone => Database is stored locally on the server (on local harddrive)
advantages => Can be on any server type
dis-advantages => Two Primary Zones cannot communicate with each other directly(because stored on local db).
                  This causes additional traffic.
                  No fault tolerance on failures.
                  It can be easily hacked
                  no security

PRIMARY ZONE ACTIVE DIRECTORY INTEGRATION
=========================================
Database stored in active directory
DNS Server put on Domain Controller
For fault tolerance need atleast 2 active DNS if one DNS goes down other takes over
All records are stored in active directory
Full security

Secondary zone
==============
Used for load balancing
Delegation record put on secondary zone

Stub zone
=========
Database stored locally and get them from primary
used for conditional forward
Record types
1. Start of authority(TTL etc..)
2. NS Records (for ww.zyz.com send request to serverA)
3. A (glue host) maps to ipaddress
