- maps domain names to ip address
- is a service on the TCP/IP n/w
- DHCP dynamically assigns ip address to machines on the n/w
- usually built into routers for normal users
- In enterprise world we have windows servers and bind which can serve as dns
- dhcp servers should always talk to dns servers, because when a dhcp server generates a dynamic ip, 
  that should be recorded in the dns tables
- reverse dns maps ipaddr to domain name

Basic working
=============
1. User requests for www.google.com
2. Request goes to DNS which returns the ip addr the domain name matches to
3. User computer uses this ipaddr to go through the router to the internet to find which subnet/machine/port the ipaddr
   maps to and connects to the same.


- Important to note that a given DNS server will have mappings only for the local LAN
- So if the DNS server does not have a record in it's table's it will query the remote DNS server to get the mapping
