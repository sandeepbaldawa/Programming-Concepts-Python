- maps domain names to ip address
- is a service on the TCP/IP n/w
- DHCP dynamically assigns ip address to machines on the n/w
- usually built into routers for normal users
- In enterprise world we have windows servers and bind which can serve as dns
- dhcp servers should always talk to dns servers, because when a dhcp server generates a dynamic ip, 
  that should be recorded in the dns tables
- reverse dns maps ipaddr to domain name

Basic working
=============
1. User requests for www.google.com
2. Request goes to DNS which returns the ip addr the domain name matches to
3. User computer uses this ipaddr to go through the router to the internet to find which subnet/machine/port the ipaddr
   maps to and connects to the same.


- Important to note that a given DNS server will have mappings only for the local LAN
- So if the DNS server does not have a record in it's table's it will query the remote DNS server to get the mapping

Components of DNS
=================
1. Root level server
2. TLD - Top level domain

What are zones?
==============
- Zones are how the database records for dns are stored.
- 4 main zone types
   Primary Zone
   Primary Zone with Active Directory integration
   Secondary Zone
   Stub Zone
   
Primary Zone => Database is stored locally on the server (on local harddrive)
advantages => Can be on any server type
dis-advantages => Two Primary Zones cannot communicate with each other directly(because stored on local db).
                  This causes additional traffic.
                  No fault tolerance on failures.
                  It can be easily hacked
                  no security
