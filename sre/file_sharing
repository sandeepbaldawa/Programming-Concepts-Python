questions:-
==========
machines:- sizing, heterogenous, IOPs, queueing, 

server:- async, sync?, vertical scaling to handle threads synchronously? or have asynch threading model

Network:- bandwidth?


Compared to the synchronous model, the asynchronous model performs best when
=============================================================================
1. There are a large number of tasks so there is likely always at least one task that can make progress.
2. The tasks perform lots of I/O, causing a synchronous program to waste lots of time blocking when other tasks could be running.
3. The tasks are largely independent from one another so there is little need for inter-task communication 
(and thus for one task to wait upon another).
