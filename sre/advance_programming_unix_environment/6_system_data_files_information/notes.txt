Passwords are stored in /etc/passwd in ascii format

four lines from the /etc/passwd file on Linux could be
   root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
   squid:x:23:23::/var/spool/squid:/dev/null
   nobody:x:65534:65534:Nobody:/home:/bin/sh
   sar:x:205:105:Stephen Rago:/home/sar:/bin/bash
   
1. There is usually an entry with the user name root. This entry has a user ID of 0 (the superuser).
2. Some fields in a password file entry can be empty. If the encrypted password field is empty, 
   it usually means that the user does not have a password. (This is not recommended.)
3. The shell field contains the name of the executable program to be used as the login shell for the user. 
   The default value for an empty shell field is usually /bin/sh. Note,however,thattheentryforsquidhas/dev/nullasthelogin shell.
   Obviously, this is a device and cannot be executed, so its use here is to prevent anyone from logging in to our system 
   as user squid.
4. There are several alternatives to using /dev/null to prevent a particular user from logging in to a system. 
   For example, /bin/false is often used as the login shell. It simply exits with an unsuccessful (nonzero) status; 
   the shell evaluates the exit status as false. It is also common to see /bin/true used to disable an account; 
   it simply exits with a successful (zero) status. 
   Some systems provide the nologin command, which prints a customizable error message and exits with a nonzero exit status.
