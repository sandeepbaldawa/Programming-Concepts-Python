what is 3 way handshake
======================
Happens before a http request is done
- Use between client to server to see if they can even connect and speak to each other.

Client send to Server => SYNC(fundamentally meaning can I connect to you? from client)
Server send to Client => SYNC, ACK (fundamentally meaning I acknowledge you made a request and yes you can connect to me from server)
Client send to Server => ACK(fundamentally meaning server acknowledged, thanks we are now ready for all communication from client)

If SYNC/ACK not received means
1. Server is down
2. Or client blocked by firewall

How does connection end?
=======================
Once client received a http request response/file etc.

Client send to Server => FIN(fundamentally meaning am done from client)
Server send to Client => FIN, ACK (fundamentally meaning I acknowledge you made a finish request and yes you can dis-connect to me from server)
Client send to Server => ACK

What is a traceroute, and how does it work?
==========================================
understanding of ICMP, TTL, and routing hops. Bonus points if they also know UDP trace routing.

What is NAT? Where would you use it? How does it work? What are some limitations?
=================================================================================

What is QoS? How does it work? Where would you apply it? When is it enforced?

What I'm looking for: knowledge of traffic prioritization schemes, at least a vague understanding of classification levels at the header level, understanding of judicious application to time and 
latency sensitive protocols, and knowledge of contention vs. non-contention
===========================================================================
