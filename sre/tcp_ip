what is 3 way handshake
======================
Happens before a http request is done
- Use between client to server to see if they can even connect and speak to each other.

Client send to Server => SYNC(fundamentally meaning can I connect to you? from client)
Server send to Client => SYNC, ACK (fundamentally meaning I acknowledge you made a request and yes you can connect to me from server)
Client send to Server => ACK(undamentally meaning server acknowledged, thanks we are now ready for all communication from client)
