The SSH system is a secure replacement for rlogin, rcp, and telnet. It uses cryptographic authentication 
to confirm a user’s identity and encrypts all communications between the two hosts.

The main components of SSH are 
1. server daemon
2. sshd
   sshd can authenticate user logins in several different ways 
   sshd can also use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the remote host. 
   For that to happen, the remote host’s public key (generated at install time) 
   must be listed in the local host’s /etc/ssh_known_hosts file or the user’s ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.
   Authentication policy is set in /etc/sshd_config
3. and a few user-level commands, notably ssh for remote logins and sftp/scp for copying files. 
   Other components are an ssh-keygen command that generates public key pairs and a couple of utilities
   that help support secure X Windows.
