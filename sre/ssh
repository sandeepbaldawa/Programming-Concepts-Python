How do I debug SSH problems?
============================
1. Examine the SSH server logs. 
   These will reported by syslog according the server's syslog configuration, often in /var/log/messages.
   sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log 
   On Red Hat, it's /var/log/secure
   
2. Add the -vvv switch to your SSH client command line, causing it to report verbosely on what it does   

3. Run an instance of the server in debug mode, and test your connection against it:
   [on the server as root]
   # sshd -d -p 1234

   [on the client]
   $ ssh -vvv -p 1234 ...
   
4. Check the ssh environment
operating systems on the client and server hosts, and their versions
SSH software on the client and server hosts, and their versions

5. When I try to connect to an SSH server, I get the error "Connection refused."
   No SSH server is running where you tried to connect. Double-check the hostname and TCP port number: 
   perhaps the server is running on a port different from the default?
   try running netstat -tanp on the server side to see on which port the sshd service is bound to.
   
6. When I log in, the message of the day (/etc/motd) prints twice.
   Both sshd and the login program are printing it. 
   Disable sshd 's printing by setting the serverwide configuration keyword PrintMotd to no.

7. When I log in, I see two messages about email, such as "No mail" or "You have mail."
   Both sshd and the login program are checking for mail. 
   Prevent sshd from checking by setting the serverwide configuration keyword CheckMail to no.
   
8. The SSH1 server says "Permission denied" and exits.
   This occurs if all authentication techniques have failed. Run your client in debug mode and read the diagnostic messages,

9. How do I authenticate without typing a password or passphrase?
   ssh-copy-id

10. I get prompted for my password or passphrase, but before I have time to respond, the SSH server closes the connection.
    Your server's idle timeout value may be too short. If you are a system administrator of the server machine, 
    set IdleTimeout to a larger value in the serverwide configuration file
