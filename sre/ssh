How do I debug SSH problems?
============================
1. Examine the SSH server logs. 
   These will reported by syslog according the server's syslog configuration, often in /var/log/messages.
   
2. Add the -vvv switch to your SSH client command line, causing it to report verbosely on what it does   

3. Run an instance of the server in debug mode, and test your connection against it:
   [on the server as root]
   # sshd -d -p 1234

   [on the client]
   $ ssh -p 1234 ...
   
4. Check the ssh environment
operating systems on the client and server hosts, and their versions
SSH software on the client and server hosts, and their versions
