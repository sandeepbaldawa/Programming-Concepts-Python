Goals
====
- Good interface, with minimum clicking to get to good data.
- Automation for most tasks like collecting, adding, analyzing a metric.
- Abilty to co-relate different metrics without much user intervention
- Reduce noise by giving capability to serives/users to listen to only what one is interested in
- Easy to add new people and keep up with the growth of new engineers.
- Not much touch points to add a metric. Metrics adding should be automated and error free
- Consistent set of metrics to work with
- Optimum performance and space usage.


- automated monitoring important because of the sheer scale of services to monitor. Also to reduce noise
  Publisher subscriber would be better applicable. Automated reporting too is equally important.
- Subscribers can be microservices which inrepret this data.  
- Generating graphs/pictures important for understanding behavior/anamolies etc mainly because of the sheer amount of data
  present, it will be very difficult to understand the same manually. 
- Policies and response rules to judge the system

Collecting metrics
=================
- Each Service can generate metrics.
- Collect the standard cross-service metrics automatically from every service
- broker which can publish these services and interested parties can subscribe to the same.
- resolution of metrics(intervals they are served) important.
- capacity planning for infrastructure important, since amount of data is huge
   understand WCU, RCU, IOPs, throughput, latency, 
- Configuring(adding/removing) metrics should be easy at various levels, GUI, command line, code etc.
- Programatically name the metrics so we can do things based on the format
- A push based system(forcasting what might be needed) that always sent the metrics it had regardless of being
  in a data store or not

Graphing frontend
================

- RRDtool is the OpenSource industry standard, high performance data logging and graphing system 
for time series data. RRDtool can be easily integrated in shell scripts, perl, python, ruby, lua or tcl applications.
