The kernel’s internal data structures record various pieces of information about
each process. Here are some of the more important of these:
• The process’s address space map
• The current status of the process (sleeping, stopped, runnable, etc.)
• The execution priority of the process
• Information about the resources the process has used
• Information about the files and network ports the process has opened
• The process’s signal mask (a record of which signals are blocked)
• The owner of the process

PID: process ID number
======================
The kernel assigns a unique ID number to every process.

PPID: parent PID
=================
Neither UNIX nor Linux has a system call that initiates a new process running a
particular program. Instead, an existing process must clone itself to create a new
process. The clone can then exchange the program it’s running for a different one

UID and EUID: real and effective user ID
=========================================
