Why Monitor?
============

There are many reasons to monitor a system, including:

Analyzing long-term trends
How big is my database and how fast is it growing? How quickly is my daily-active user count growing?

Comparing over time or experiment groups
Are queries faster with Acme Bucket of Bytes 2.72 versus Ajax DB 3.14? How much better is my memcache hit rate with an extra node? Is my site slower than it was last week?

Alerting
Something is broken, and somebody needs to fix it right now! Or, something might break soon, so somebody should look soon.

Building dashboards
Dashboards should answer basic questions about your service, and normally include some form of the four golden signals (discussed later in this chapter).

Conducting adhoc retrospective analysis (i.e., debugging)
Our latency just shot up; what else happened around the same time?

Lots of white-box monitoring
Some black-box monitoring for critical stuff

Latency
Traffic
Errors
Saturation
