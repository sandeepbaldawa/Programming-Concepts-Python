Why Monitor?
============

There are many reasons to monitor a system, including:

Analyzing long-term trends
How big is my database and how fast is it growing? How quickly is my daily-active user count growing?

Comparing over time or experiment groups
Are queries faster with Acme Bucket of Bytes 2.72 versus Ajax DB 3.14? How much better is my memcache hit rate with an extra node? Is my site slower than it was last week?

Alerting
Something is broken, and somebody needs to fix it right now! Or, something might break soon, so somebody should look soon.

Building dashboards
Dashboards should answer basic questions about your service, and normally include some form of the four golden signals (discussed later in this chapter).

Conducting adhoc retrospective analysis (i.e., debugging)
Our latency just shot up; what else happened around the same time?

Lots of white-box monitoring
Some black-box monitoring for critical stuff
Four golden signals
Latency
Traffic
Errors
Saturation

Black-box monitoring
====================
Testing externally visible behavior as a user would see it.

White-box monitoring
====================
Monitoring based on metrics exposed by the internals of the system, including logs,
interfaces like the Java Virtual Machine Profiling Interface, or an HTTP handler that emits internal statistics.

Dashboard
=========
An application (usually web-based) that provides a summary view of a serviceâ€™s core metrics. 
A dashboard may have filters, selectors, and so on, but is prebuilt to expose the metrics most important to its users.

Alert
======
A notification intended to be read by a human and that is pushed to a system such as a bug or ticket queue, 
an email alias, or a pager. Respectively, these alerts are classified as tickets, email alerts,1 and pages.
The dashboard might also display team information such as ticket queue length, a list of high-priority bugs, 
the current on-call engineer for a given area of responsibility, or recent pushes.
