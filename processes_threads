Processes
========
Program in execution.
They have code segment, data segment, stack segment and maybe Heap.
Advantages
----------
1. Independent
2. Good for CPU intensive workloads(like mathematical calculations)

Dis-Advantages
---------------
1. Starting processes is slow(in ms), executor/pools can help.
2. Maximum processes need to run in parallel are the numbe of cores available
3. too much context switching and scheduling time spent if number of processes are too high
4. Not suitable for IO bound workloads
