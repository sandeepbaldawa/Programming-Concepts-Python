A *writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*

A : "What's that equal to?"
B : *counting* "Eight!"

A *writes down another "1+" on the left*
A : "What about that?"
B : *quickly* "Nine!"
A : "How'd you know it was nine so fast?"
A : "You just added one more"
A : "So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"
