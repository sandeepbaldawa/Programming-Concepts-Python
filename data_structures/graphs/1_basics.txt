- directed vs undirected graphs
- always ask if it is a directed or undirected graph
- clique => every node is connected to every other node in the graph
- implement using
1. Adjancency list (most common way, usually use this)
2. Adjacency matrix

ADJACENCY LIST
==============
A -> {B, C}
C -> {B, D}

class Node {
   List<Node> neighbours;
   int data;
}

class Graph {
   List<Node> neighbours;
}

Finding edges easier in adjancency matrix
Finding neighbours easier in adjancency list
