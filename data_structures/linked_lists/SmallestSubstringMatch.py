Smallest Subarray Covering All Values: Let's say you are given a large text document Doc. You are also given a set S of 
words. You want to find the smallest substring of Doc thatcontains all the words in S. 
For example:
   S: ["and", "of", "one"]
   Doc: "a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate,     conveying a statement, 
         question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses"
          
  "of a main clause and sometimes one" is the solution. Note that the order in which the words appear doesn't matter. 
  Also, the length of the substring is in terms of number of characters.
